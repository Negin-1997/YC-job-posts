- **Purpose**: Extracts HTML content for individual "Who is Hiring" pages from Hacker News.
- **Key Functionality**:
  - Scrapes and stores HTML data for specific months or years.

### `Extract_URLs_Who_Is_Hiring.py`

- **Key Functionality**:
  - Parses pages to find and collect the URLs of job posts.

### `Extract_Job_Posts_Nested_Json.py`
- **Purpose**: The script processes multiple HTML files to extract only the job posts by identifying and isolating top-level comments (posts) using the ind class for indentation. It removes all replies to keep only the main job posts for each file and organizes them into a nested JSON structure.
- - **Key Functionality**:
  - Reads all .html files from a specified directory.
  - Skips replies by checking the indent attribute in the ind class.

## JSON Files

- **`Who_is_hiring_URLs.json`**: Contains URLs of "Who is Hiring" posts along with associated metadata (dates).
- **`urls_html_content_All_Titles.json`**: Contains HTML content of all page titles.

## Organized_JSON Folder
This folder contains each page HTML extracted and stored in JSON files organized by date.
